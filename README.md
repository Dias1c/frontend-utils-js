Here are long-invented tools for frontend on js.

## How To Use?

Copy js file in folder `dist/main.js` wich you want (copy css to if you want default style), set for your project.

See usage example on [`sample/index.html`](./sample/index.html)

## Customize and rebuild

1. Before customize and build, install `node_modules` with this command

```sh
npm i
```

2. Source code of [`dist/main.js`](./dist/main.js) in `src` directory, customize if you want
3. Build `main.js` from `src` with this command

```js
npm run build
```

4.  Use builded bundle on your html page (Do not forget copy styles in [`css`](./css) directory)
